# Elanco-Tick-Sightings
Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of a backend system for a web application that brings tick sighting data to life. Using a raw dataset of tick sighting data to create backend services that process, analyse and manage this data. 

Using data handling, processing pipelines, and analytics in a real-world context.

Focus:
How data is consumed, processed and presented.  
Data Handling.  
Search and Filtering.  
Data Reporting.  
Error Handling.  

System should read and normalise dataset from an excel file quickly, changing the data to be appropriate data types. Allow users to be able to search and filter sightings, provide grouped insights about tick sightings and be able to handle any data inconsistencies

Language used for backend - Python

To run code: Visual Studio Code Recommended
